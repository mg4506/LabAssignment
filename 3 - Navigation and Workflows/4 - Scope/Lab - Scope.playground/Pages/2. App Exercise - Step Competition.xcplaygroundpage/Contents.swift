## App Exercise - Step Competition

 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

 Below is a `User` struct and three `User` instances. These will be used throughout the exercises below to simulate competition in the fitness tracking app.

//:  Now write a failable initializer inside the `User` struct above that takes parameters `name` and `stepsToday` as an optional `String` and `Int`, respectively. The initializer should return `nil` if either of the parameters are `nil`. Use variable shadowing when unwrapping the two parameters.
