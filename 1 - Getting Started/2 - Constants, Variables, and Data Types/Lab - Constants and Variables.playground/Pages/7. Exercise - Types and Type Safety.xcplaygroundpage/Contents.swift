/*:
## Exercise - Types and Type Safety
 
 Declare two variables, one called `firstDecimal` and one called `secondDecimal`. Both should have decimal values. Look at both of their types by holding Option and clicking the variable name.
 */
var firstDecimal=13.75
var secondDecimal=21.65
//:  Declare a variable called `trueOrFalse` and give it a boolean value. Try to assign it to `firstDecimal` like so: `firstDecimal = trueOrFalse`. Does it compile? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var trueOrFalse=true;
//firstDecimal=trueOrFalse;
//cannot assign value of type 'Bool' to type 'Double'
print("Won't complile because firstDecimal and trueOrFalse are different types")

//:  Declare a variable and give it a string value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Does it compile? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var abc="education"
//firstDecimal=abc;
//error: cannot assign value of type 'String' to type 'Double'
print("name is a string, which cannot be assigned to a double")

//:  Finally, declare a variable with a whole number value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Why won't this compile even though both variables are numbers? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var num1=32
//firstDecimal=num1
print("age is a int, which cannot be assigned to a double")
